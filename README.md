# Tech-City-ventures-Project
<h1> Simple list app made with ReactJS </h1>
<br>
<h2> Background Information</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Computer Science + Mathematics Student (completed second year recently with decent grades)</li>
	<li>Some javascript + php experience from first year of university</li>
	<li>Java experience mostly</li>
	<li>No prior ReactJS experience</li>
	<li>Some experience in CSS</li>
	<li>Minimal experience in Laravel</li>
	<li>Rather than choosing something more sophisticated I chose the simple listing idea that was given in the Tech-City-Venture task and only focused on making that for the entire time</li>
	<li>Miss Gajjar did say this should take me around 4 hours however I dont have much Javascript or ReactJS knowledge</li>
	<li>Took me from 4pm yesterday to 3pm today and had to work overnight to complete this on time majority of the time learning</li>
	<li>Never used MongoDB, unfortunately I wanted to pass the strings over as simple CRUD function however I wasnt able to finish the tutorials on time given 24 hours</li>
	

</ul>

<h2> The Future Going Forward </h2>
<ul>
	<li>While overly stressed for the past 24 hours, looking back at how much I learnt from something simple, I am proud that I was able to learn and make something even if its something as simple as a listing app</li>
	<li>This also demonstrated that I have much to learn, I do not understand a lot of things in web development such as regular expressions to prevent blank line inputs to 'props' keyword in ReactJS</li>
	<li>This is precisely why I believe it is best if I work an unpaid 'student-intern' part-time for few months until I am good enough regardless of the 'qualified' junior developer you may end up hiring</li>
	<li>I can alaways earn money later as a developer</li>
	<li>But for now [working as a team + learning programming language(s) + building softer skills + guidance + experience] > [money]</li>
	<li>I believe this mitigates many risks for Tech-City-ventures aswell, after all a free employee is better than no employee for a start-up</li>
</ul>

<h2> Thank You for providing the oppurtunity which kicked me into the gear of learning new things which I would never have otherwise, I am more than appreciative regardless of the outcome </h2>
